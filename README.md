## Description

The basic idea is that Ajax is a technique which allows you to send and receive information to and from your server without reloading the page. This is a massive increase to performance.

## Setup

* Clone this repository
* Set document root to the top level directory of the repository
* Import the database, called "bakery", found in `sites/db-backup`
* Create a user for the database: username = "logan", password = "root"
* Point browser to localhost
* Site maintenance account info: username = "admin", password = "root"
